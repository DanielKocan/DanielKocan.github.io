# Wasteland Walkers (Unreal Engine Team Project, 8 Weeks)

For this project, I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team of designers and visual artists to develop an Unreal Engine game over eight weeks. We followed Agile/Scrum processes, adapting flexibly to meet evolving goals and deliver a polished playable experience under tight deadlines.

# ‚ú® My Key Contributions
### ‚úÖ Gameplay Programming

Worked extensively in Blueprints and C++ to implement key gameplay features:

* Moving walker and local co-op up to 4 players.

* Collision handling and interaction logic.
* Functional minimap system.

* Turrets and shooting mechanics (guns, ammo, hit detection).

* Bug fixes, performance tweaks, and system improvements.
* Created new Blueprints and extended functionality via C++ when more control or performance was needed.

### ‚úÖ Agile & Scrum Process

* Participated in regular standups, sprint planning, and sprint reviews.
* Adjusted my work dynamically based on team feedback and shifting design priorities.
* Documented progress and shared updates to keep the team aligned.

### ‚úÖ Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) System

* Researched DDA methods as part of my personal development goal.
* Designed and implemented an easy-to-use tool that adjusts game difficulty in real time, enhancing player engagement and balancing challenge.

### üî• Why This Was Challenging

‚è≥ Tight Team Deadlines ‚Äî With only 8 weeks and a multi-role team, clear communication and fast iteration were essential. I had to stay adaptable and proactive, prioritizing tasks that unblocked others and contributed to the core game experience.

üõ† Balancing Blueprint and C++ ‚Äî Knowing when to use Blueprints for speed and flexibility vs. C++ for power and efficiency was key. I improved my hybrid development skills significantly.

üéØ Making Systems Designer-Friendly ‚Äî My DDA tool wasn‚Äôt just functional ‚Äî it was built to be usable by designers without needing code changes, which required thoughtful UI and clear integration.

### ‚úÖ What I Learned

ü§ù Effective Team Collaboration ‚Äî I strengthened my communication, teamwork, and Agile practice, learning how to sync with designers, artists and other programmers smoothly.

üß† Feature Ownership & Research ‚Äî Taking ownership of a feature like DDA meant going beyond coding: I researched best practices, tested designs, gathered feedback and iterated to deliver something meaningful to the game.

üîß Problem-Solving Across Systems ‚Äî From AI to UI, I worked across diverse gameplay systems, improving my debugging, system design and integration skills.
