# Voxel Raytracing Engine + Paintball Game  
#### In this challenging graphics and physics programming module, I developed a voxel-based raytracing engine in C++ â€” and as a creative extension, I turned it into a playable paintball game!

âœ¨ Key Features I Built   
âœ… Advanced Lighting & Shadows

* Added point lights, spotlights, and directional lights, all casting realistic shadows using shadow rays.
* Implemented efficient light visibility testing to enhance scene realism.

âœ… Material System

* Developed a robust material framework: reflective surfaces, recursive reflections (with recursion caps), and physically accurate dielectric (glass-like) materials.

âœ… Anti-Aliasing & Camera Improvements

* Replaced the simple pinhole camera with a camera supporting an aperture, significantly improving image quality through basic anti-aliasing.

âœ… New Primitives & Scene Elements

* Added sphere primitives.
* Added a skydome for a satisfying environmental backdrop.

âœ… Creative Expansion: Paintball Game

* Leveraged the raytracing engine to develop a fun paintball game where players can shoot paintballs into the voxel environment, blending graphics programming with gameplay mechanics.

âœ… Performance Profiling & Optimization

* Profiled the raytracer to identify bottlenecks and applied targeted optimizations for faster rendering.
* Integrated ray-based physics to roll a ball across the voxel world, combining visual rendering with interactive simulation.

### ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
* This project deeply strengthened my understanding of:
* Recursive algorithms (especially in reflections)
* Light transport and shadow calculation
* Materials and surface interaction models
* Performance profiling and optimization strategies
* Combining visual engines with interactive physics and gameplay systems

It was a demanding but incredibly rewarding project where I bridged graphics theory with hands-on game creation.
